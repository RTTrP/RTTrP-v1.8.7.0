<h2>Real-Time Tracking Protocol</h2>
<br>
Welcome to the **Real-Time Tracking Protocol (RTTrP)** repository!<br>
<br>
The RTTrP is a suite of protocols developed to transmit tracked motion information between systems.<br>

RTTrP is comprised of two separate protocols which share a common header:<br>

* RTTrPM (Real-Time Tracking Protocol - Motion)
* RTTrPL (Real-Time Tracking Protocol - Lighting)
<br>
Within this repository you will find stub code for Python and C++ for both RTTrPM and RTTrPL.<br>

Python Reader is sample python code on how to read RTTrPM and RTTrPL packets.

For further information, including packet definitions and protocol use cases, please visit the [Wiki](https://rttrp.github.io/RTTrP-Wiki/).<br>
