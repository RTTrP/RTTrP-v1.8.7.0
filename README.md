# Real-Time Tracking Protocol
Welcome to the **Real-Time Tracking Protocol (RTTrP)** repository!

The RTTrP is a suite of protocols developed to transmit tracked motion information between systems.

RTTrP is comprised of two separate protocols which share a common header:

* RTTrPM (Real-Time Tracking Protocol - Motion)
* RTTrPL (Real-Time Tracking Protocol - Lighting)

Within this repository you will find stub code for Python and C++ for both RTTrPM and RTTrPL.

Python Reader is sample python code on how to read RTTrPM and RTTrPL packets.

For further information, including packet definitions and protocol use cases, please visit the [Wiki](https://rttrp.github.io/RTTrP-Wiki/).
